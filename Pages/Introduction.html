    <h4>What is domestic violence?</h4>



<div class="intro paragraph">
      Abusive behaviour at home can take different structures, and most
      frequently, it consolidates a few sorts of brutality, making sadness,
      wounds and sickness. Also, aggressive behaviour at home results in more
      extensive social and monetary expenses, including those of administrations
      to treat and support mishandled ladies and deal with culprits, besides
      lost business and efficiency, sabotaging ladies' abilities, and in any
      event, dialling back financial development.
