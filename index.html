        <h1>Domestic Violence</h1>
        <h2>Welcome to my website</h2>

        <p>
          Domestic Violence is an issue that occurs on a daily basis. It's
          something that the society assumes "normal" in relationships and
          something that should be kept as a secret in homes. This website's
          purpose is to make everyone aware of how mentaly toxic and physically
          exhausting it is to be going through Doemstic Violence and why it
          needs to be known!

          Violence speaks many languages, has many colours and many different
          communities."

       Unfortunetly there just isn't an age limit for Domestic Violence to happen in homes.
       Hence why it needs to be stopped. The only way we can do this if we 
       mordenize our community and the society. Educate them how important it is to know how deadly 
       domestic violence can be and that opening up about 
       it is not a way to bring shame or disgrace to their reputations.
